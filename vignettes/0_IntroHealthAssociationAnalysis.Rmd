# Preamble 
## Objectives 
- Discuss key issues when designing and conducting health association analysis using UK Biobank wearables data (Chapter 0)
- Set up RStudio access (Chapter 1)
- Outline steps in preparing UK Biobank data for health association analysis, indicating available resources (Chapter 2)
- Conduct a basic health association analysis in the UK Biobank dataset (Chapter 3)
- (Optional) Introduce Compositional Data Analysis in the context of movement behaviour data (Chapter 4)

## How to use this tutorial 
This tutorial is designed both as a tutorial and as a reference document. In the practical, it is probably a good idea to read through it sequentially. In the weeks of the Data Challenge, you will be able to come back to different sections and use them as you need. 

We all know that with a dynamic document/notebook it is tempting to click through the pieces of code pressing "play" quickly as possible. That is not the way to get the most out of this tutorial. Some of the code chunks might not be things you need. Sometimes, the most useful thing might be to follow links to some of the additional resources and spend time reading those. And don't just focus on the code sections: time spent with a pen and paper designing the analysis might be some of the best-spent time!

## Question? Bugs?
If you have a question, feel free to speak to any of the tutors or contact Rosemary Walmsley (rosemary.walmsley@gtc.ox.ac.uk). 

There are probably bugs. If you find them, please let me (Rosemary) know and I will fix them!
